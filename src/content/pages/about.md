I like science and data and combining them in different ways to make cool data science projects. Using my background in geophysics, I like to make interesting visualizations of earth science data, which so far, have been mostly about earthquakes.

I welcome any feedback on my code and analyses. If you have interesting data set ideas, please share! My favorite topics are educational policy, geophysics, Star Trek, and cats. And probably aliens.

I am currently employed as a Curriculum Developer at [https://lambdaschool.com/](Lambda School).
